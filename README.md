# Gradient-Descent-and-Cost-Function
Using numpy specific values of 'm' and 'c' are found which optimizes the 'Mean Squared Error'

1.IN Linear Regression the aim is to find a best fit line for the given datapoints.
2. IN such cases the Mean Squared Error(MSE) needs to be minimised.
3. The MSE is the squared difference of actual datapoints and predicted datapoints (predicted by the linear regression line).
4. MSE can be minimised by using Gradient Descent.
5. By plotting MSE vs 'm' and MSE vs 'c' which is an upward parabola with a global minimum.
6. Our aim is to find that values of 'm' and 'c' for which the MSE is least and the line is the best fit line.
